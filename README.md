# Code Examples
 
This repository contains files which all demonstrate a concept in C#. There is no particular order, but I suggest starting from 1 for beginners.

`Examples` will only contain minimal examples of select concepts, while `Programs` will use these concepts to create functional and perhaps useful programs.

## DISCLAIMER
It is important to keep in mind that there is no perfect code, so look at any code you see in these guides with a critical eye: there is always room to improve.
I do not make any claim to be writing good code, but I think the code in this repository is good enough to be a guide.

## Pull Requests
I will accept pull requests if they are an objective improvement, but keep in mind that these are supposed to be read by someone who is very new to C# or even programming in general, so if the pull request makes the code overly-complicated or against the spirit of the repository, I will reject it.
