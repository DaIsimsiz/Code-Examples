# Code Examples
 
This repository contains files which all demonstrate a concept in C#. There is no particular order, but I suggest starting from 1 for beginners.

`Examples` will only contain minimal examples of select concepts, while `Programs` will use these concepts to create functional and perhaps useful programs.
